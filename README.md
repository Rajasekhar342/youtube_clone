Youtube Clone(Video Sharing App)

This app is built by using React.js,newest version of material-UI(version 5) and APIs.

I used material-UI for layout and design, media queries for satisfactory responsiveness on all 
devices and most importantly fetching data from unlimited sources using RapidAPI.com

used VS code RapidAPI extension for testing APIs.

This React application consisting of stunning video sections, custom categories, channel pages and most importantly you can play videos straight from this app and also see related videos and
much more.

Finally, deployed this app to web application hosting service netlify.com
